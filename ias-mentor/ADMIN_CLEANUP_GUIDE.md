# Admin Cleanup Guide - Duplicate Payment Management

## 🧹 Overview
The admin dashboard now includes automatic duplicate detection and cleanup functionality to prevent and remove duplicate payment requests.

## 🔍 Duplicate Detection

### What are Duplicates?
- Multiple **pending** payments for the same user and same product
- Same `userId`, `productId`, and `productType` combination
- **Only pending payments** are considered for duplicate detection and cleanup
- **Rejected and confirmed payments are completely ignored** in duplicate detection

### Automatic Detection
- Duplicates are automatically detected when payments are loaded
- Orange warning banner appears when duplicates are found
- Shows the number of duplicate groups detected

## 🛠️ Cleanup Features

### 1. **Manual Cleanup**
- Click "Clean Up Duplicates" button in the warning banner
- Review which payments will be removed
- Confirm the cleanup action
- Only the oldest payment in each group is kept

### 2. **Automatic Prevention**
- Payment API automatically cleans up duplicates during creation
- Prevents new duplicates from being created
- Maintains data integrity

### 3. **API Endpoint**
- `POST /api/admin/cleanup-duplicates?admin=true`
- Removes duplicate pending payments
- Returns count of removed payments

## 📊 Cleanup Process

### Before Cleanup:
```
User A - Product X (Pending) - Created: 10:00 AM
User A - Product X (Pending) - Created: 10:05 AM  ← Duplicate (will be removed)
User A - Product X (Pending) - Created: 10:10 AM  ← Duplicate (will be removed)
User A - Product X (Rejected) - Created: 10:15 AM  ← Ignored (not pending)
User A - Product X (Confirmed) - Created: 10:20 AM  ← Ignored (not pending)
```

### After Cleanup:
```
User A - Product X (Pending) - Created: 10:00 AM  ← Kept (oldest pending)
User A - Product X (Rejected) - Created: 10:15 AM  ← Unchanged (not pending)
User A - Product X (Confirmed) - Created: 10:20 AM  ← Unchanged (not pending)
```

## 🎯 Cleanup Rules

### ✅ What Gets Cleaned:
- **Only duplicate pending payments** for same user + product
- Only the newest duplicates are removed
- Oldest pending payment is always preserved
- **Rejected payments are never considered duplicates**

### ❌ What's Protected:
- **Confirmed payments** (never deleted, never considered duplicates)
- **Rejected payments** (never deleted, never considered duplicates)
- Payments for different users
- Payments for different products
- **Any payment that is not pending**

### 🔒 Safety Features:
- Only pending payments are affected
- Confirmed payments are never touched
- Cleanup is reversible (can be undone by restoring from backup)
- Detailed logging of all actions
